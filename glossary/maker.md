# Maker #

Créateur,
Celui qui a fabriqué...

* Knifemaker: fabricant de couteaux

## RATIONALE ##

Maker is commonly translated as 'fabricant' but this frames the meaning
to a narrow scope (manufacturer), with a connotation of industry.

I preferred to use 'créateur', which has connotations of design and art,
and echoes the common translation of the (capitalized) Maker as 'Créateur'.
I also used the phrase 'Celui qui a fabriqué', in some places, restoring
the original emphasis on making.

I kept 'fabricant' part of the translation of 'Knifemaker'. Qualified
by 'de couteaux' (of knives), there is little ambiguity with an industry.
