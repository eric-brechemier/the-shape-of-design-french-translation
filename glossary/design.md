## RATIONALE ##

The English term 'Design' [is often used AS IS in French][DESIGN],
but the connotations are different: industrial design is
strongly implied, and so is the translation "conception"
suggested by the [GDT][CONCEPTION].

[CONCEPTION]: http://gdt.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/ficheOqlf.aspx?Id_Fiche=8365304

On the other hand, translating only 'Graphic Design'
as "graphisme", or "arts graphiques" would be too
restrictive, reducing the larger scope of the book.

I thus settled for "création", which is often used in the
context of "création artistique", graphic design and design
in general. It comes with a religious/sacred connotation,
which is not out of a place here, and resonates with the
radiating illustration of the front cover.

I considered keeping the word "design" in French in the context of
industrial creation: « le design raffiné d'une lampe »
(“the refined design of a lamp”, chapter 2), but eventually went with
subtler translation « le dessein raffiné d'une lampe », which plays on
the homophony between "dessein" (design, project) and "dessin" (drawing),
which evokes both the design (intent) and the line (shape) of the lamp.
