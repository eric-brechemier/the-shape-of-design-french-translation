## RATIONALE ##

The English term ‘Design’ [is often used AS IS in French][DESIGN],
but the connotations are different: industrial design is
strongly implied, and so is the translation ‘conception’
suggested by the [GDT][CONCEPTION].

On the other hand, translating only ‘Graphic Design’
as ‘graphisme’, or ‘arts graphiques’ would be too
restrictive, reducing the larger scope of the book.

I thus settled for ‘création’, which is often used in the
context of ‘création artistique’, graphic design and design
in general. It comes with a religious/sacred connotation,
which is not out of a place here, and resonates with the
radiating illustration of the front cover.

I considered keeping the word 'design' in French in the context of
industrial creation: « le design raffiné d'une lampe »
(“the refined design of a lamp”, chapter 2), but eventually went with
subtler translation « le dessein raffiné d'une lampe », which plays on
the homophony between ‘dessein‘ (design, project) and ‘dessin‘ (drawing),
which evokes both the design (intent) and the line (shape) of the lamp.
