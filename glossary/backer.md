Mécène

## RATIONALE ##

While the crowdfunding vocabulary is still new, and I could find no
recommended translation for ‘backer’, I found related terms by looking
at [translations for the term ‘patron’]
(http://www.wordreference.com/enfr/patron)
used in
[this page of acknowledgments.]
(http://shapeofdesignbook.com/kickstarter/).

The term ‘mécène’, is more suitable here than ‘donateur’ found in the
[French Wikipedia page about crowdfunding]
(http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdfunding),
because it concerns more specifically art projects and exhibitions.
