# Framework #

Cadre

## RATIONALE ##

The word 'cadre' (fr) can be used to translate 'framework' both in a figurative
and in a literal context. This is also the case of 'structure' (fr), which I
left aside after considering it, because the word 'structure' (en) also appears
in the copy in the close vicinity of 'framework', and I preferred to keep the
two words distinct in the French translation as well.
