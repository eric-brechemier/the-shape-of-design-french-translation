Modifier à sa guise

## RATIONALE ##

The word "remix" was borrowed from English and is used as is
in French; a verb was derived, "remixer". There is a strong
connotation of music though, and it is not clear how one would
remix a text from a French perspective.

I favor the translation using a French verb, "modifier", extended
with "à sa guise" (as you wish) to include the idea of freedom.
