Modifier à sa guise

## RATIONALE ##

The word 'remix' was borrowed from English and is used as is
in French; a verb was derived, 'remixer'. There is a strong
connotation of music though, and it is not clear how one would
remix a text from a French perspective.

I favor the translation using a French verb, 'modifier', extended
with 'à sa guise' (as you wish) to include the idea of freedom.
