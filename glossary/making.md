# Making (noun) #

Outil

## RATIONALE ##

This is not a straightforward translation: the direct substantive of 'to make',
"le faire", is rarely used alone in French, only in compound expressions such
as "le savoir-faire" (know-how). I chose to convey the idea of making through
the concept of the tool, "l'outil" which is intertwined with the meaning
and the action of making. This metonym works well in the context of this book,
which considers making in relation with the shape and the movement of the hand
and the tool within.
