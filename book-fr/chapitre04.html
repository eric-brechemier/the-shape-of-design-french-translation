        <!-- My body and mind are linked. -->
        <!-- This is hardly a ground-breaking discovery, -->
        <!-- but for the longest time, -->
        <!-- it was a bit of knowledge -->
        <!-- that never changed my behavior. -->
        <!-- If my mind needed to wander to think about a project, -->
        <!-- I’d typically sit in a chair, -->
        <!-- furrow my brow, -->
        <!-- sip my coffee, -->
        <!-- and scribble a few things into my sketchbook. -->
        <!-- That’s no good, though: -->
        <!-- if the mind needs to wander, -->
        <!-- best let the body do the same. -->
        <!-- A short walk is more effective -->

        <!-- If I can’t get out of the studio and into the city, -->
        <!-- I’ve taken to letting my hand wander on a pad of paper -->
        <!-- by drawing spindly, loopy, mindless marks. -->
        <!-- I make the sorts of drawings -->
        <!-- people produce on the backs of envelopes -->
        <!-- while on hold with the gas company. -->
        <!-- There is no subject, -->
        <!-- just as a good walk has no destination; -->
        <!-- their purpose is movement. -->
        <!-- My pencil cuts across the paper -->
        <!-- like a figure skater zipping around her rink, -->
        <!-- overlapping, skipping, and spinning. -->
        <!-- The skater ignores the mark -->
        <!-- that comes in the wake of her movement, -->
        <!-- and I do the same. -->
        <!-- This drawing isn’t aesthetic, -->
        <!-- it is kinetic -->
        <!-- &ndash; more like dancing than drawing. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- I’ve noticed that as I draw these knots on the page, -->
        <!-- the hitches in my mind begin to unravel. -->
        <!-- I love my trick in spite of its spotty rate of success, -->
        <!-- because it is the minimum amount of effort and thought -->
        <!-- I can put into working. -->
        <!-- Scribbling’s efficiency is a golden ticket -->
        <!-- for someone prone to creative block; -->
        <!-- the scrawl is an easy, mindless task -->
        <!-- which looks like work, -->
        <!-- and can sometimes turn productive. -->
        <!-- The drawn knots are no consequential thing themselves, -->
        <!-- but they do seem to eventually -->

        <!-- A few months ago, -->
        <!-- I found myself drawing my tangles onto tiny napkins -->
        <!-- while on a flight from the west coast to Chicago. -->
        <!-- I had a pressing project that needed attention, -->
        <!-- and I wanted to have a clear direction -->
        <!-- by the time the flight landed. -->
        <!-- So, obviously, -->
        <!-- I spent most of the flight looking out the oval window -->
        <!-- instead of working. -->
        <!-- I could see Illinois in all of its flat, tiled splendor: -->
        <!-- farm after farm, as far as the eye could see, -->
        <!-- a tight grid of wheat browns and cornstalk greens. -->
        <!-- Two plots merged to make a rectangle, -->
        <!-- four merged to make a square, -->
        <!-- and a circularly tilled plot interrupted the quilted arrangement. -->
        <!-- I couldn’t see everything from up here, -->
        <!-- so I imagined the other parts. -->
        <!-- I filled in the gaps -->
        <!-- by remembering my drives to Chicago, -->
        <!-- and pretended that the plane cabin -->
        <!-- had the smell of soy and corn permeating through -->
        <!-- as my car had when I took road trips -->
        <!-- along <span class="osf">I-55</span> years ago. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- My pen continued gliding over the napkin. -->
        <!-- I could see through my window -->
        <!-- how the terrain fit together -->
        <!-- and how the crops were planted. -->
        <!-- My pen zipped back. -->
        <!-- I imagined the names of the streets -->
        <!-- in an imagined sleepy Illinois town -->
        <!-- with a biblical name. -->
        <!-- My mark doubled over itself. -->
        <!-- I pictured how the blocks shrunk in size -->
        <!-- as they approached the center of town, -->
        <!-- then looped around the city square. -->
        <!-- My pen gained momentum. -->
        <!-- I thought about how there must be a Lincoln High -->
        <!-- somewhere down there, -->
        <!-- with its champion Cardinals -->
        <!-- that won the state football title this past year. -->
        <!-- My pen whipped back around and ripped the napkin, -->
        <!-- now thin from the flood of ink it had absorbed. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- How nice it would be to get into a plane -->
        <!-- and fly over our work. -->
        <!-- Maybe we’d see some patterns -->
        <!-- and be able to deduce a structure -->
        <!-- that would let us improvise. -->
        <!-- We could see some fields and a few roads, -->
        <!-- and riff our way to a bunch of kids in Cardinal uniforms -->
        <!-- running through a banner at a pep rally. -->
        <!-- I spent the rest of the flight thinking -->
        <!-- about how helpful it is -->
        <!-- to have an understanding of the work’s structure, -->
        <!-- and decided that the best way -->
        <!-- to see the work’s larger patterns -->
        <!-- was with a vantage similar to my seat in the sky. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- All design work seems to have three common traits: -->
        <!-- there is a message to the work, -->
        <!-- the tone of that message, -->
        <!-- and the format that the work takes. -->
        <!-- Successful design has all three elements -->
        <!-- working in co-dependence to achieve -->
        <!-- a whole greater than the sum of the individual parts. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- The message is what is being said, -->
        <!-- the kernel of information to be communicated, -->
        <!-- or the idea trying to be expressed through the work. -->
        <!-- If the work of design is to be a tool, -->
        <!-- the message is the utility of the tool. -->
        <!-- The message speaks to the objectives of the work, -->
        <!-- and is the promise that the work makes. -->
        <!-- The value of the work is defined -->
        <!-- by the usefulness of that promise, -->
        <!-- and the work’s ability to make good on it. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- The tone is the domain of design, -->
        <!-- the arrangement the message takes -->
        <!-- and the inflection with which it is said. -->
        <!-- Tone expresses sentiment -->
        <!-- and endears the audience to the work. -->
        <!-- It is often mistaken for style, -->
        <!-- but the two should not be confused: -->
        <!-- style is a formal device -->
        <!-- used on the surface -->
        <!-- to establish the tone of the work. -->
        <!-- Successful projects choose a tone -->
        <!-- that fits the message appropriately. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- The format is the artifact, -->
        <!-- the thing being produced. -->
        <!-- It is often a physical form, -->
        <!-- such as a poster, brochure, pottery, painting, or sonnet, -->
        <!-- but also includes the choices -->
        <!-- that alter a work’s context and placement. -->
        <!-- Increasingly, -->
        <!-- these “artifacts” are becoming less physical, -->
        <!-- and may take the form of an application, website, -->
        <!-- or even an experience. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- The relationship between the three characteristics -->
        <!-- could be thought of as levers on a machine: -->
        <!-- different settings can be chosen and adjusted -->
        <!-- to yield different outcomes. -->
        <!-- Specific settings have emerged -->
        <!-- by imitating the success of others, and, -->
        <!-- through trial and error, -->
        <!-- produce well-established couplings, -->
        <!-- much like food and wine. -->
        <!-- We frequently return to these settings -->
        <!-- because of their effectiveness. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- Consider the typical promotional poster for a concert. -->
        <!-- The work’s message is “attend this event,” -->
        <!-- and it provides relevant information, -->
        <!-- such as the performing artists, -->
        <!-- time and date, venue, and cost to attend. -->
        <!-- The tone for the design would be dictated -->
        <!-- by the sound of the music being performed, -->
        <!-- and the designer works -->
        <!-- to produce a fit between the two. -->
        <!-- Posters for metal bands should look different -->
        <!-- than those for classical performances. -->
        <!-- In this example, -->
        <!-- all possible aesthetic outcomes -->
        <!-- are unified by the format: -->
        <!-- ink on paper as a poster. -->
        <!-- The format, however, still has variables. -->
        <!-- For instance, what will be the size of the poster -->
        <!-- and where will it hang? -->
        <!-- No matter what the settings for the levers are, -->
        <!-- all choices are subservient to the objective. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- The promotional poster is a standard, -->
        <!-- tried-and-true setting for the three levers, -->
        <!-- but we must be willing -->
        <!-- to consider new opportunities -->
        <!-- and different settings for the levers. -->
        <!-- Creative breakthroughs often occur -->
        <!-- when fresh configurations are explored -->
        <!-- in the message, tone, and format. -->
        <!-- The interplay of the three levers -->
        <!-- becomes a framework for improvisation -->
        <!-- by providing enough structure to guide exploration, -->
        <!-- but enough freedom to end up in unexpected and fresh places. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- Suppose the designer realized -->
        <!-- that most of the promotion for a classical concert -->
        <!-- should occur online, -->
        <!-- because tickets were being sold through their website, -->
        <!-- and the information could spread more easily -->
        <!-- between friends on the web. -->
        <!-- She could use the potential of screens, -->
        <!-- rather than spending time -->
        <!-- on ideas limited by the restrictions of printing. -->
        <!-- A new format has different affordances and opportunities, -->
        <!-- so rather than recreating a static design that works on paper, -->
        <!-- she could produce something native to the web -->
        <!-- and build motion and sound into the solution. -->
        <!-- Perhaps the design could have videos of the musicians -->
        <!-- discussing certain parts of the symphony to be performed, -->
        <!-- working as an educational resource -->
        <!-- that connects the musicians to the audience -->

        <!-- Adrià’s desire to question everything -->

        <!-- how ideas develop and new inventions are envisioned. -->
        <!-- The adjacent possible originated with scientist Stuart Kauffman -->
        <!-- as a label for the fundamental atomic combinations -->
        <!-- required for biological development. -->
        <!-- Evolution occurs one step at a time, -->

      <p>
        <!-- Johnson extends Kauffman’s concept -->

        <!-- There are prerequisites for us -->
        <!-- to reach what we desire -->
        <!-- as we pursue better circumstances and new inventions. -->
        <!-- For instance, -->
        <!-- in order to invent something like the printing press, -->
        <!-- we must first invent language and an alphabet, -->
        <!-- produce paper and ink, -->

        <!-- There had to be many contributions and breakthroughs -->

      <p>
        <!-- Most inventions are recombinations of existing things, -->

        <!-- What instigates that magic to make hybrids, -->

        <!-- and to inspire new settings for the three levers? -->

        <!-- while others seem to come out of nowhere. -->
        <!-- Turning avocado into caviar, for example, -->

        <!-- The faster horse is a recombination of the three levers -->
        <!-- in a predictable way: -->

        <!-- The most important advancements, -->

        <!-- of what is better. -->
        <!-- They can see through the fog -->

        <!-- There’s a pattern to seizing latent opportunity -->
        <!-- to produce unprecedented outcomes, -->

      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- It begins with the proper mindset, -->
        <!-- established by asking Why questions -->
        <!-- to define the true objectives of the work. -->
        <!-- The inquiry emphasizes the project’s true purpose -->
        <!-- and sheds any false presumptions -->
        <!-- about how to do the work -->
        <!-- or what it should be. -->
        <!-- It ensures the design’s relevancy -->
        <!-- by forcing one to ask -->
        <!-- about its consequence in the world. -->
        <!-- The designer can then make decisions -->
        <!-- that use the defined function as guidance. -->
        <!-- The fruits of this questioning -->
        <!-- define and emphasize -->
        <!-- the cornerstone of successful design: -->

        <!-- Similar questioning should also be directed -->
        <!-- towards the form of the work. -->
        <!-- An understanding of the three levers -->
        <!-- provides a structure to conceive of fresh configurations. -->
        <!-- Using the structure and affordances of content, tone, and format, -->
        <!-- one can riff on how the elements interplay -->
        <!-- and come to exceptional ends. -->
        <!-- Part of the exploration for novel design -->
        <!-- is using the materials at our disposal, -->
        <!-- especially those whose full potential -->
        <!-- have not been realized. -->
        <!-- We should look around us -->
        <!-- to see what available resources -->
        <!-- are not being fully used, -->
        <!-- like the affordances of a screen -->
        <!-- in the promotional materials for the concert, -->
        <!-- or the new ingredients Adrià used at elBulli. -->
        <!-- This method modifies either the content or the format, -->
        <!-- which alters the tone’s qualities -->
        <!-- as it negotiates those modifications. -->
        <!-- It is a simple thought, -->
        <!-- but one way to have a creative process come to different ends -->
        <!-- is by beginning with new materials. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- The true purpose of the process -->
        <!-- is to create an accurate picture of the world. -->
        <!-- The misfit creative individual -->
        <!-- is stubbornly unwilling to abide -->
        <!-- by anyone else’s vision of the world -->
        <!-- without first testing those assumptions. -->
        <!-- There’s a desire for an honest assessment, -->
        <!-- because we can only create what we want -->
        <!-- by understanding what is achievable. -->
        <!-- We must know the edges of the adjacent possible -->
        <!-- before we can begin to imagine -->
        <!-- making the world better. -->
      </p>

      <p>
        <!-- Often, what we perceive to be possible -->
        <!-- dims in comparison to what we can actually do. -->
        <!-- This gap creates the opportunity -->
        <!-- for people like Henry Ford, Walt Disney, -->
        <!-- and all the other magicians -->
        <!-- who have expanded what we think of the world. -->
        <!-- The rest of us believe the line -->
        <!-- that defines what is possible -->
        <!-- is much closer to our feet -->
        <!-- than it actually may be. -->
        <!-- The creative misfits ask their questions -->
        <!-- to realize the line’s true location, -->
        <!-- and conclude that there is enough room -->
        <!-- for a great leap forward. -->
        <!-- Our questioning, and the imagination it inspires, -->
        <!-- allows us to perform the most important magic: -->
        <!-- to make the world grow -->
        <!-- by revealing -->
